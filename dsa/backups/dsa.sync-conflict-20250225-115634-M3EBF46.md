# Vow

This is a vow that I will only watch 1 minute of kaiju no 8 [ then solo levelling ]for every leetcode problem I solve   [valid till I complete 2000 questions]

I am taking this vow cuz I have the basic of the DSA but failed to complete the stuff since 3+ years and now its time to **finish it** [that's what ramos said] ! 

Currently watching Kaiju no8
already watched 6 eps 
no there are 6 more remaining<br>
total 142 minutes 

les gooooo


I plan to document my whole dsa journey here on out cuz this is for placement preparation and documents stands as a reflection to improvise the performance -- <br><br>
P.S: not to forget what I study


0 - even and not a prime number
1 - not a prime number
