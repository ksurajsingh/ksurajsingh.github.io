<h1>DSA stands for Data Structures and ALgorithms</h1>
<p>Being good at DSA should mean that you are good at use data structures and algorithms to solve a problem in most
  optimal way possible .<br>It is usefull as it increases the thinking ability of a human to solve a problem in the
  given resources / utilizing the given resources to meet the requirements and also have a good performance. </p>
<p>This page teaches you - I wouldn&#39;t say all - but something that would be enough to last a human life time | <br>
  In order to get better at programming logics I use OOPs as well | <br> learn shell scripting BTW , it drastically
  increases your programming power | <br> what is shell scripting ? , bruh are you using windows [buhahaha , That&#39;s
  what few linux user would say but, I am different I do like windows for what it is - if someone wants something else
  they can have something else. What I meant was - are you using buttons ? I am still unemployed and I might also be
  able to give interviews to microsoft so I guess I shouldn&#39;t stay stuff like that .No offence to windows I wanted
  to say / I meant GUI . BTW imagine - me an arch linux user giving interview to microsoft, I really like windows - its
  good and stuff , Its support to run certain executables is the best feature like games . And there are other good
  things like security , anti virus features etc.]?</p>
<p>To make the learning the way it has to be and not by some outdated types like sitting in a room and just using pen
  paper - I introduce the idea of shinobi ranking , <br> You have to compete studying through one level to reach a level
  / unlock a level that&#39;s above it - obv there are no restrictions / constraints - it is just a convention - if you
  cheat , you still know where you stand | <br> passing level would be if you understood everything till the level of a
  KAGE </p>

<h1>Analyse the Problem</h1>
<h5>Understand the problem. Take a second to recall whatever you learnt in relevance with the problem</h5>
<h1>Deduction</h1>
<h5>Think of the specific problem statement -&gt; break it down to simpler parts -&gt; think of the solution to simpler
  parts -&gt; combine the solution</h5>
<h1>Flowchats</h1>
<h5>Most important part of problem solving is on paper . . . that is where 80% of the problem is solved from easiest to
  the most difficult problem</h5>
<h1>Always document the process</h1>
<h5>Helps you keep going throught the topics like a Flow !</h5>

<h1>Java</h1>
<p>Java is platform independent and hence its class files can be circulated across machines without tampering </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>![WARNING] Though JDK is convert those class executables into machine code . A higher lower version of JDK cannot
    convert a .class file into machine code that was compiled by a higher version of JDK</p>

<h1>Conversion [typeCasting]</h1>
<h5>Implicit conversion is done from type of lower or equal size to higher size of type.</h5>
<p>Narrowing conversion the upper one - explicitly declare it , if you want the conversion , else just show it in
  desired form while printing <code>(char)a</code> where a is an int</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">int i=0;
    float p=i;
  </code></pre>
<h5>If you want to convert to lower size type you need to explicitly mention that</h5>
<pre><code class="language-bash">int i=0;
    char p=i;
  </code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-bash">int i=0;
    char p=(char)i
  </code></pre>

<h1>Scope of Variables</h1>
<h5>when variables are initialized inside a loop, its only available there not even outside the loop in the same
  function</h5>
<pre><code>#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;

    int main(){
    int a=10;
    if(a&gt;0){
    int b=20;
    }

    printf(&quot;%d\n%d&quot;,a,b);
    }
  </code></pre>
<p><img src="pics/undeclared.png" alt="undeclaredError"><br></p>
<p> / document the practise problem that is the patterns ones and etc in some squid game manner like how the pink
  soldiers ask for square or triangle etc....</p>
<h1>Bitwise operators</h1>
<pre><code class="language-java">int a=10;
    int b=2;

    System.out.println(a&amp;b);
    System.out.println(a|b);
    System.out.println(a^b);
    System.out.println(~a);// &quot;~&quot; this is the complement operator
    System.out.println(a &lt;&lt; 2); // left shift by 2 raised to 2 , as it is converted into binary that is
    essentailly &quot;a*(2**2)&quot;. &lt;br&gt; For ex - 6 &lt;&lt; 2 is
    // 6 - 0000110
    // 2 left shifts makes - 0011000 = 24
    // which is 6*(2**2), 6*4=24
    System.out.println(a &gt;&gt; 2); // right shift i.e. -4
  </code></pre>
<p>Convert the values of variables to binary then perform the specified operations and you will get the result.<br>Make
  use of few properties such as : a^a=0, since all the bits are same<br>a^0=a.</p>
<h1>Loops / functions</h1>
<p>Pratise this for better understanding of loops </p>
<p>++i , increments before using i </p>
<p>i++ , increments later </p>
<p>mostly usefull in print statements<br>since </p>
<p>if you do </p>
<pre><code class="language-c">i=5;
    i++;
    // [or] ++i;
    printf(&quot;%d&quot;,i);
    // There will be no change
  </code></pre>
<p>in for loops </p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>initialises the var , no matter what. The first value of the var is the value initialised in the parameters of
      the loop [cuz point 4]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>checks the condition ; if true goes into the body </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>executes the body </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>now performs what ever opetaion is mentioned in the for loop </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>goes to step 2</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>![NOTE] the comparision step in a for loop is done n+1, the last time is for the rejection take the following as an
    example: </p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code class="language-java">int i=1;
    for(;i&lt;n;i++)
    System.out.println(i);// this prints till 5
    System.out.println(i); // this prints till 6 , cuz i++ , i got incremented but rejected by the condition step ,
    though it is still a function variable and not a loop variable , the trace is kept by the function and the
    incremented value is printed
  </code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-java">
    int a=60,b=80;

    if(a++ &gt;60 &amp;&amp; b++ &gt; 80 ){
    System.out.println(&quot;Inside if&quot;);
    }
    else{
    System.out.println(&quot;Inside else&quot;);
    }

    System.out.println(&quot;a: &quot;+a+&quot; &quot;+&quot;b: &quot;+b);
  </code></pre>
<pre><code>Inside else
    a: 61 b:80
  </code></pre>
<p>since a is incremented after being processed 60 is not &gt; 60 so inside else<br>logical operators uses short-circuit
  and hence since first part is taken as not true the remaining part is unnecessary to evaluate and hence skips that
  part - which essentially skips the part where b is incremented and b remains 80!</p>

<h2>Trianlge</h2>

<h1>Pass by value</h1>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static void increment(int n){
    n++
    }

    // in main

    increment(n);

    // n won&#39;t increment since n&#39;s value is passes and not n itself and hence n&#39;s value is incremented and
    not n , to be more precise the local varible of the increment function was incremented
  </code></pre>
<p>The fix to this is by using pointers in C</p>
<h1>Function Overloading</h1>
<pre><code class="language-java">
    public static int sum(int a, int b){
    return a+b;
    }
    public static double sum(int a, int b){// not possible , same parameters are already defined in another function of
    the same name
    return a+b;// though if this was the only function make sure to pass int to it and it will return the double
    }
    public static int sum(int a){ // works
    return a;
    }
  </code></pre>
