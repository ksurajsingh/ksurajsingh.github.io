  <h3>Elementary Data organisation</h3>
  In computers - the information is generally representated by the states of '0' or '1', <br>
  '1' being the <b>'ON'</b> state and <br>
  '0' being the <b>'OFF'</b> state.<br>
  <br><br>
  <blockquote> Information = Instruction + Data </blockquote>
  <b>Data</b> is part of an information and a value of set of values if temporarily stored in the program data or stored
  permanently on a file in storage devices.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Values</b> are generally either character or numeric<br><br>
  The different data values in the record are inter related to each other. <br>
  In orderto make use of these relationships by the program , It is necessary to represent the data values in the
  organizes form. <br><br>
  This oranization of data is known as data structures.
  <blockquote>Data Structures = Oraganized data + operations </blockquote>
  So it can also be defined as logical or mathematical model of a particular organization of data. <br>

  <h2>Applications of Data Structure</h2>
  <hr>
  <ol>
    <li>Retrieve the individual data element</li>
    <li>To solve the relationship between the data elements that are relevant to the solution of the problem</li>
    <li>Describe the operations that must be performed on the logically relateddata elements, <br>
      The operations such as Creating, Displaying , Inserting , Deleting , Retrieving etc. </li>
    <li>Devise methos of representing the data elements in the memroy of the computers,<br> that will reduce the loss of
      fragmentation and also allows to select the memory configuration or storage structures </li>
    <li>Unambiguours-gives freedom to the programmer to choice any type of language that best suits for a particular
      program </li>
    <li>Improve the efficiency of the algorithm</li>
  </ol>
  <br><br>
  There are two main types of data structure -
  <ul>
    <li>Primitive data structure</li>
    <li>Non primitive data strucure <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Linear data structure</li>
        <li>Non Linear data structure</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br><br><br>
  <h2>Primitive Data Structure</h2>
  <code> int , float , char , double , long , boolean </code>
  <h2>Non primitive data structure</h2>
  <h4> Linear Data Structure</h4>
  A data structure that establishes adjacency between the elements, where all the elements are stored in the memeory
  linearly or sequentially<br>
  <code> Arrays, linked list, Stack, Queues, Heap</code>
  <h4>Non Linear Data Structure</h4>
  Any data structure that establishes a relation ship other than adjacency relationship is called non-linear
  relationship <br>
  In trees children , parent , grandparent relationship can be established. <br>
  <br><br>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Arrays:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>are a finite ordered set of homogeneous elements, which are stored in adjacent cells in memeory. </li>
        <li>The data is represented by a single name identified by a subscript </li>
        <li>Arrays can be two dimensional that is 2-D,3-D,4-D and N-D </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Stacks:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>are a linear data structures where the data is inserted and deleted from one end which is called as the
          <code>top</code>
        </li>
        <li>Data is stores and retrieved in last in first out order </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Linked list:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>A list is a linear sequence of data objects of the same type. </li>
        <li>The list maybe <code>singly,doubly,circular</code></li>
        <li>The linked list is a linear collection of data items called as nodes</li>
        <li>A node is divided into two parts - (1)Information / data field (2) Link field [a pointer to the next node of
          the list]</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Trees:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>A tree is a finite set of vertices that has a vertex called as root and remaining vertices are called as
          sub-trees</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Operations on data structures</h2>
  <hr>
  Some of the common operations on data structures are : <br>
  <ol>
    <li>Insertion</li>
    <li>Deletion</li>
    <li>Traversing: accessing each element exactly once is called traversing</li>
    <li>Sorting</li>
    <li>Merging</li>
  </ol>
  <br><br>
  <hr>
  <h2>Abstract Data Type [ADT]</h2>
  <hr>

  <ul>
    <li>is a specification of set of data and set of operations that can performed on the data.</li>
    <li>This is oranized in such a way that the specification of values and operations on those values are separated
      from the representation of the values and the implementation of the operation.</li>
    <li>An abstract data type is a data type with associated operations, but whose representation is hidden.</li>
    <li>for example: Lists,sets,graphs </li>
    <li>This is mainly done so that the implementation of these operations are written once in the program. And any
      other part of the program that needs to perform that operation on the ADT can do so by calling the appropriate
      functions </li>
      <li>To manage the complexity of progblems and the problem-solving process,computer scientists use abstraction to alow them to focus on the <code>"big-picture"</code> <br>
        without getting lost in the details</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Typically input , output, pre-conditions , post-conditions and assumptions to the ADT are specified as well</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>
    <h4>Examples</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>String ADT</li>
      <li>List ADT</li>
      <li>Stack ADT [LIFO]</li>
      <li>Queue ADT [FIFO]</li>
      <li>Binary Search Tree ADT</li>
      <li>Priority Queue ADT</li>
    </ul>

    <br><br>
    Private functions are accessible to the public functions and public functions are accessible by the application programs <br>

    <br><br><br>
    <hr>
    <h2>Algorithm</h2>
    <hr>
    An algorithm is a step by step procedure for performing some task in  a finite amount of time <br>
    <b><u>COMPLEXITY:</u></b> of an algorithm is the measure ofthe amount of time and/or space requried by an algorithm for an input of a given size(n). <br>
    <em><b><u>Space complexity:</u></b></em>It indicates the amount of storage [ memory ] required for running the algorithm <br>
    <em><b><u>Time complexity:</u></b></em>of an algorithm is the amount of time it needs in order to run to completion<br>
    <br><br>
    Keeping this in mind - there are two thing to consider in computer prgramming : <br>
    <ol>
      <li>Appropriate Data Structure </li>
      <Li>Appropriate [efficient] Algorithm </li>
    </ol>
    Use space-time tradeoff to increase the efficiency of whatever attribute is required.<br>
