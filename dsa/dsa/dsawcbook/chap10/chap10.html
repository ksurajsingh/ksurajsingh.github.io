  <b>Graphs are a set of finite points called <code>vertices</code> or <code>nodes</code></b>. <br>
  Some of them are connected to others via lines or arrows called <code>edges</code> or <code>arcs</code>
  <h3>Types</h3>
  <h4>Based on connection</h4>
  <dl>
    <dt>Complete Graphs</dt>
    <dd>Has an edge from all points to all points 
      <ol>
        <li>Has <code>n(n-1)/2</code> edges</li>
        <li>if zero nodes, a trivial graph <code>null graph</code> exists</li>
        <li>if one node, a trivial graph <code>singleton graph</code> exists</li>
      </ol>
    </dd>
    <dt>Connected Graphs</dt>
    <dd>Has a path between every pair of vertices <br>
      <ol>
       <li>      <em>A path is a sequence of vertices where each consequetive pair is connected by an edge.</em>       </li> 
       <li>      <em>Number of edges in a path is called as the <code>length of the path</code></em> </li>
       <li>      <em>if there are no repeated vertices - <code>Simple path</code></em> </li>
      </ol>
      <code>NOTE:</code> If a graph has an edge bw every pair of vertices: if its direct edge: <code>complete</code> , indirect : <code>connected</code> graphs.
    </dd>
    <dd>If its a <code>digraph</code> - <b>strongly connected graph</b></dd>
    <dd>If its an <code>undirected graph</code> - <b>connected graph</b> <br> <em>Unfortunately undirected graph cannot be a strongly connected graph. . .</em> <br><em> Ikr it ain't its mistake - it just has ability which is termed as disability here . <em><br><b><em> It is essential for a strongly connected graph to have DIRECTED edges towards and from all vertices in  a graph</em> </b>
    </dd>
    <dd>If its a <code>digraph</code> with one pair having one a sinlge directed edge between them - <b>weekly connected graph</b></dd>
    <dd>ex: <img src="./media/connectedTypes.jpg" alt="types of connected graphs"></dd>
    <dt>Bi-Connected Graph</dt>
    <dt><ol>
      <li>A connected graph</li>
      <li>No articulation point in the graph</li>
    </ol></dt>
    <dt>Disconnected Graphs</dt>
    <dd>A graph where atleast one pair of vertices have no path connecting them.</dd>
    <dt>Graph with isolated vertices</dt>
    <dd>If there is one node/vertex such that it has no edges or arcs to any other node/vertex of the graph, <br>
      That node is <code>isolated node </code>.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <h4>Based on edges</h4>
  <dl>
    <dt>Directed Graph aka <code>Digraph</code></dt>
    <dd>
      A graph whose edges are <code>directed</code> / "one-way".
      <ol>
        <li>Represented as G=(V,E)</li>
        <li><code>V</code> is a set, whose elements are called vertices or notes</li>
        <li><code>E</code> is a set, whose elements are <b>ordered</b> pairs of elements of <code>V</code>, called edges or arcs</li>
        <li>If exists, directed edge (v,e) . <code>v</code> is called <b>TAIL</b> and <code>e</code> is called <b>HEAD</b> <br>
          v-&gt;w , which is distinct from w-&gt;v.
        </li>
        <li>Eg: <img src="./media/digraphex.jpg" alt="example for digraph"></li>
      </ol>
    </dd>
    <dt>Unidirected Graph</dt>
    <dd>
      A graph whose edges are <code>undirected</code> / "two-way".
      <ol>
        <li>Represented as G=(V,E)</li>
        <li><code>V</code> is a set, whose elements are called vertices or notes</li>
        <li><code>E</code> is a set, whose elements are <b>unordered</b> pairs of <b>distinct</b>elements of <code>V</code>, called edges or arcs</li>
        <li>If exists, undirected edge (v,e), denoted by    v-w  , same as w-v </li>
        <li>Eg: <img src="./media/undirectedGex.jpg" alt="example for undirected graph"></li>
      </ol>
    </dd>
    <dt>SubGraph</dt>
    <dd>A graph whose vertices and edges are subset of another graph is called a <b>subgraph</b>
      if G=(V,E) then subgraph could be <code>G<sup>1</sup>=(V<sup>1</sup>,E<sup>1</sup>)</code>
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <h4>Graphs that have weghts are called as weighted graphs else <em>non weighted Graphs</em></h4>
  A pair of vertices is said to be adjacent if and only if there is a edge between them , making <code>e(v,w)</code> for <em>e,w</em> being adjacent. <br>
  An egde is said to be incident if it is connected to that vertices , <code>e(v,w)</code> is incident on <em>v,w</em> <br>
  <dl>
    <dt><b>These are only for directed graph</b></dt>
    <dt>Indegree</dt>
    <dd>The <code>number</code> of edges having <code>v</code> as their <b>terminal </b> vertex is called <code>indegree of v</code></dd>
    <dt>Outdegree</dt>
    <dd>The <code>number</code> of edges having <code>v</code> as their <b>initial </b> vertex is called <code>outdegree of v</code></dd>
    <dt><b>For outdegree graphs</b></dt>
    <dd>We just called it <code>degree</code> - <b>number of edges</b></dd>
  </dl>
  <h3>Cyclic</h3>
  <li>A path of <code>non-zero</code> length with <code>v</code> as <b>initial</b> and <b>final</b> vertex.</li>
  <li>These are called <em>cyclic graphs</em> else acyclic graph</li>
  <li>If no vertices are repeated - <code>Simple Cycle</code></li>
  <h3>Loop</h3>
  <li>Single edge having connected to and from the same vertex</li>
  <h3>Generally</h3>
  <li>If a vertex has 0 indegree, we define it as the <code>source</code> vertex.</li>
  <li>If a vertex has 0 outdegree, we define it as the <code>sink</code> vertex.</li>
  <h3>DAGs - Directed Acyclic Graphs</h3>
  <h3>Articulation point</h3>
  <li>A vertex in an undirected connected graph is an articulation point if and only if removing it and edges throught it disconnects the graph.</li>
  <li>Removing the articulation point could increase the number of connected components.</li>
  <li>ex: <img src="./media/articulationex.jpg" alt="example of articulation point"></li>
  <h3>BiConnected  Graph</h3>
  <h5>Properties</h5>
  <ol>
      <li>There is a simple cycle throught any two vertices</li>
      <li>There exists two vertex-disjoint path between any two edges</li>
  </ol>
  The above are not to be satisfied for a Biconnected graph with only 2 nodes.But for more than 2 nodes.
  <li>ex: <img src="./media/biconnectedex.jpg" alt="example for biconnected graph"></li>
  <li>ex: <img src="./media/biconnectedex2.jpg" alt="example for biconnected graph"></li>
  <h3>Representation</h3>
  Since a graph is a non-linear DS. <br>
  Representation are done in - 
  <ol>
    <li>Adjacency Matrix</li>
    <li>Adjacency List</li>
    <li>Path Matrix</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Adjacency Matrix</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>  Has 'n' rows and 'n' columns </li>
    <li>  It only contains of 0s and 1s . </li>
    <li>  1s where (i,j) has an edge. </li>
    <li>  Therefore Adjacency Matrix only represent undirected edges. </li>
    <li>  If the graph is weighted - we could replace <code>1</code> by its weight.And <code>0</code> by <code>infinity</code>. </li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Adjacency List</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Each node has a linked list that contains link to nodes that <b>ONLY IT</b> has an direct edge to</li>
    <li>ex:  <img src="./media/adjacencyliste.jpg" alt="adjacencyList"></li>
    <li>In a directed list, where n is nodes and e is edges , n=e</li>
    <li>In undirected there are 2 nodes in list for every edge , therefore n=2*e</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Path Matrix</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Same as Adjacency Matrix</li>
    <li>The values are updated even if an indirect edge i.e a path is found bw i,j</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Traversal</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>There is no first node or root node. Hence, traversal can start from any node</li>
    <li>[ unlike trees or list ] In a graph we only traverse to those nodes that are reachable from the initial node, so we have to keep changing our initial node to traverse all reachable paths</li>
    <li>[ unlike trees or list ] A single node can be visited more than once. Hence we keep track of <code>status</code> of each node.</li>
    <li>[ unlike trees or lists ] Graphs have different sequences for the same technique of traversal.</li>
    <li><code>OBV THOUGHT:</code> ONLY connected graph traversal include all the nodes.</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Depth-First-Search [Recursive or Iterative] [Stack]</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Uses stack</li>
    <li>Select a node</li>
    <li>Traverse on one direction untill reach <code>end</code></li>
    <li>if reach <code>end</code>, go to <code>init</code> node</li>
    <li>Search for another path and repeat last 2 steps</li>
    <li>if no path - repeat from step 2</li>
    <li>Once all nodes are done <code>return</code></li>
    <li><em>Recursive uses implicity stack while iterative uses a user-defined stack</em>, Learn about this.</li>
    <li>ex: <img src="./media/dfsq.jpg" alt="dfs question"> <br> <img src="./media/dfss.jpg" alt="dfs solution">
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Breadth First Search [queue]</h4
  <ol>
    <li>Pick a node <code>source</code></li>
    <li>Traverse the neighbours of <code>source</code> <em>Add it to the queue</em></li>
    <li>Traverse the neighbours of <code>neighbours of source</code> <em>Add it to the queue</em></li>
    <li>Does backtrack just proceeds with the next node that was considered when first picking the neighbours [ <em>i.e the next node in the queue</em> ]</li>
    <li>ex: <img src="./media/bfsq.jpg" alt="bfs question"> <br> <img src="./media/bfss.jpg" alt="bfs solution"></li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Complexity</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Depends on the number of nodes and the representation used to store the graph</li>
    <li>For both BFS and DFS - [ n-nodes, e-edges ]<dl>
        <h4>Time AND Space Complexity</h4>
      <dt>Adjacency Matrix</dt>
      <dd><code>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</code></dd>
      <dt>Adjacency List</dt>
      <dd><code>O(n+e)</code></dd>

    </dl></li>
