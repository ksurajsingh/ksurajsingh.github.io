  <h2>Asymptotic Notations</h2>
  These notations are used when the give size "n" tends to increase upto infinity and its corresponsing complexity <br>
  The order of growth of the running time of an algorithm gives gives a simple characterization of the algirthm's efficiency and also allows us to compare the relative performance of alternative algorithms. <br>
  Usually,an algorithm that is asymptotically much efficient will be the best choice for all but very small inputs.<br>
  <hr>
  <h1>Certain cases</h1>
  <h4>Worst Case:</h4> It gives the maximum value of the complexity function for any possible input<br>
  <h4>Best Case:</h4> It gives the minimum value of the complexity function for any possible input<br>
  <h4>Average Case:</h4> It gives the expected value of the complexity function . Most complicated to analyse<br>
  To analyse the algorithms., computer scientists used several symptotic nottations and important notatoins among them are : <br>
  <h3>Big-oh-notation</h3>
  This gives an upper bound function . <br>
  Which indicates that the function will be the worst-case that it does not consume more than this computing time 
  <h3>Omega-notation</h3>
  This notation is used to find the lower bound behaviorof the function. <br>
  This indicates that below this computing time the algorithm cannot perform better i.e The algorithm will take atleast this much amount of time<br>
  <h3>Theta-notation</h3>
  There exists a special notation to denote for functions having the same time complexity for lower bound and upper bound and this notation is called the theta - notation whih is denoted by &theta;.
