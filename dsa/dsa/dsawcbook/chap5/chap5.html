  <h2>Linear Search</h2>
  This is the simplest searching algorithm for all. <br>
  I just traverses across the array to find the key. <br>
  Begins the search from the first or the last element and keeps traversing in an iteratable fashion to the other end of the list. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Best Case: </b>O(1). <em>When element is found at the very first index.</em>
  <b>Worst Case: </b>O(1). <em>When element is found at the last index of traversal.</em>
  <b>Average Case: </b>O((n+1)/2). <em>When element is found right in the middle of the list.</em>
<br><br><br>

  <h2>Indexed Sequential search</h2>
  This is where the index of every element is accessiable just like in arrays . <br>
  Therefore we can directly access the element using sequence , applying various techniques like Binary search etc. <br>
  Some data types are heaps and trees are not indexed or rather sequenctial so the techniques that could be applied here for <b>Optimization</b> are different. <br>
  <br><br><br>

  <h2>Binary Search</h2>
  Binary Search is a searching algorithm where : <br>
  If the array is sorted - or if we are able to sort the array , <br>
  Finding the arrays's middle element serves as a key component . <br>
  A comparision is made with the key and the middle element . <br>
  If the key is smaller that would mean that the element lies in the lest part of the middle element , <br>
  That is from first element to <em>middle-1</em> . <br>
  Else it would mean that the element lies in the second half that is <em>middle+1</em> to last. <br>
  This is possible as the array is sorted.
  <br><br><br>

  <h2>Interpolation Search</h2>
  This type of search also works well only on sorted arrays. <br>
  A probing method is used which make guesses on where the element could be found <br>
  Using bounds of upper and lower limit . <br>
  That probe is the range of the upper limit and lower limit within the data space <br>
  If the element is well withing the probe the probe narrows down to the middle terms of the neartest possible location <br>
  Very similar to binary search but it searches for the nearest element value instead of searching for the middle most element <br>
