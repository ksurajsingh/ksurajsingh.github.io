  <h1>OOPS</h1>
  <hr><hr>
  <pre>

   <h1>Encapsulation</h1>
   <ul>
    <li>Making few methods stay inside a object</li>
    <li>Making a few objects stay inside a class</li>
   </ul>

   <h1>Inheritance</h1>
   <ul>
    <li>If there is a class that can have properties that could be a part of a superset. <br>
      Then a superset class can be created which would be its parent.And the original class can now take its properties <br>
      by inheritance using the keyword <code>extends</code>
    </li>
   </ul>

   <h1>Polymorphism</h1>
   <ul>
    <li>If there are same classes then you can call that class specific to one class by </li>
    <li>Referring to that class while declaring that object.</li>
    <li>You can refer to the point and point to the child <br>
    <code>vehicle v = new car()</code>
    later you can make v point to the other class like 
    <code>v = new bicycle()</code>
    </li>
   </ul>

   <h1>Abstraction</h1>
   <ul>
    <li>You won't know what is actually written inside a function</li>
    <li>But you will have access to maybe read but definitely use it</li>
    <li>Only if you change one function - everyone will be able to use it , the updated version</li>
   </ul>


   in java declarating , instancing , and initialisatoin works differently 

   <code>int maxSpeed</code>
   if you only write this much it will be initialised to 0
   but 
   if its a non-primitive type and you are access the value using a reference [ which all non-primitive types do ]
   then 
   say 
   <code>String color</code>
   this case since String is reference to some chunk in memory and not particular piece - it will just be initilised as NULL 

   same goes for instancing - created a new objects 
   <code>int maxSpeed =  new int</code>
   <code>String color = new String</code>

   initialisation - 
   <code>int maxSpeed = new int[5]</code> not allowed since int is just a primitve type
   you could make it an array like <code>int[] maxSpeed = new int[6]</code>
   or use the non-primitive [ interger only ] type 
   <code>Integer maxSpeed = new Integer(120)</code> now this is a wrapper class for Int
   <code>String color = new String("blue")</code>

   also if you were to do 
   <code>Integer maxSpeed</code>
   this wouldn't initialise to 0 but <code>NULL</code>

   Wrapper classes in java are object oriented classes for primitive types. 
   Following
   <img src="./media/wrapper.png" alt="wrapper classes">


   If there is a parent and a child and both have constructor. 
   if you declare an object of the child - you need to define the <code>super(_param_)</code> for the constructor of the super class .
   by default it happens without any params . If you super constructor reqs params you need to explicity mention <code>super(_param_)</code> before anything else 
   in the child constructor.


   <b>Class casting</b> converting a class object to some other object - 
   upcasting - parent reference points to child.

   downloading - child reference points to parent. [ needs to be explicit and on the instance of parent ]
   check by 
   if( v instanceof car ){
      car c = (car)v
   }

   don't do <code>child c = new parent()</code>
   instead 
   <code>parent p = new child()</code>
    <code>child c = (c)parent</code>


   Every class that you create in java is a subclass of the <code>Object</code> class.

   <h2>Exception</h2>
   use <code>throw new _exception_name_</code> to throw exceptions

   if a method is throwing an exception use <code>throws</code> in the function signature to throw is to the function that called it.

   To handle that exception any any point in the stack trace use 
   <code>try{}catch{}</code>
   Why use this - this won't hinder the flow of the program and helps to continue the further execution.

   There is a main class called as <code>Exception</code>
   like how every object is a subclass of <code>Object</code>
   every exception [ user defined ] or [system defined] is a subclass of <code>Exception</code>


   The <b>Finally</b> keyword is used to execute a block definitely after a <code>try{}catch{}</code>
   like closing a scanner using <code>sc.close()</code>
