    hey guys n grils , how is it going . Today I was just not feeling upto it <br>
    BTW just like last time we have a chinese speggati with lasanga going on for this semester's projects with a minor
    one to top it <br>
    Showing clear intents of 2FA by enemy for our mortality<br>
    <b>P.S:</b> Coming to the main point since I wasn't feeling upto it I fork bombed myself today <br>
    Lemme explain : <br>

    <br>

    Why did I call it <em>invisible</em> here ? <br>
    Technically its not <br>but<br>Since the name of the function is just a colon <code>:</code> it isn't much of an
    attention grabber/seeeker for the nakes hooman eye [maybe cats could spot it ]<br>
    A fork bomb is one of the many child tricks [ script kiddies ] thing that people could fall for [ skill issue ].
    <br>
    It acutally is a very good command / function / routine that makes your computer eat resources for an invisible
    parasite <br><br>
    So what actually happens is not just an infinite loop but an infinite function innovation call <br>
  </p>

  <br>
  <h1>Pros</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Since it is a fork process the tree grows exponentially and hence it eats the resources at an exponential rate
    </li>
    <li>The <code>ctrl + c</code> or <em>Sigint</em> formally [ signal interrupt ] won't work since it only applies to
      the parent process and the child <b>Could be run in instances that are different than the parent's shell / out of
        the parent's shell </b> esentially turning into an <u> orphan </u> . This would render <em>Sigint</em> as null [
      but does quit the parent process ]</li>
    <li>Not only the <code>CPU</code> nor the <code>RAM</code> is eaten but processes like these <em>forks</em>eat up
      both CPU and RAM
      <ul>
        <li>up to my understanding : </li>
        <li>It eats up CPU as it keeps on calling many functions so there are the process that run to assign those
          functions memroy in stack and in the virtal address like GOT [ global offset table ] and PLT [ procedural
          linkage tables ] </li>
        <li> It eats up the RAM as it keeps storing the processes in the stack , there for the stack keeps expanding at
          an <u><b>EXPONENTIAL</b></u> rate </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Explaination</h1>

  <p class="blog">
    The fork bomb is just a <em>function defination + invocation </em> infinitely <br>
  <ol>
    <li>the <code>:</code> is the name of the function</li>
    <li>the <code>()</code> thingy is to hold the parameters / call it as function declaration </li>
    <li>in the function <code>{</code> we have : <br>
      <ol>
        <li>the main defination <code>:|:</code> that calls the function with name <code> : </code> and pipes the output
          <code> | </code> to the same function <code> : </code> <br>
          This forms <code> :|: </code>
        </li>
        <li> Now is a key component of the function <code> &amp; </code> is the one which send / pushes the command that
          was specified before it to the background and continues with the processes further </li>
        <li> further we have <code> } </code> function close </li>
        <li>and the end of the line symbol <code>;</code></li>
        Till here is what is actually sufficient to run the fork bomb for modern shells [ ran in my zsh ] and if formal
        procedures and to ensure completeness : <br>
        <li> we have the initialiation of the bomb detonation <code> : </code> which is the function call which actually
          runs the function here . If in case the bomb doesn't start / run , you might be missing this call </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li> This makes the <code> :(){:|:};: </code> </li>
  </ol>

    Now let's see how to stop this ?
  </p>
  <h1> How to Stop this? </h1>
  <p class="blog">
    we can use <code>SIGTERM</code> functions like :<br>
  </p>
  <li>pkill</li>
  or<br>
  <li>killall</li>
  <p class="blog">
    with the pid or name of the process in respective commands <br>
    The SIGTERM acutall terminates the whole process <em>including<b> Backgruond</b></em> processes <br>

    <br>
    The above are ways to handle if medium emergency levels to exercise some amount of restriction <br><br>
    As sometimes it might even stop / not work <br>
    If you want surity [ what ever the spelling of sureity is ] then do a <code>SIGKILL</code> using <br>
    <em><code>kill -9 </code> </em> to ensure its complete termination
    BTW: <code> kil -2 </code> : SIGINT <br>
    <code> kill -15 </code> : SIGTERM <br>
    <code> kill -9 </code> : I am not writting everything again just use eyes . <br>
    <br><br><br>
    Another way if you have the system in hand prior to exection would be :
    <br><br>
  </p>
  <li> To limit the particular user to execute only a certain amount of processes at a particular time by <code> &lt;
      username &gt; hard nproc &lt;limitOf-numberOfProcesses&gt;</code></li>
  or <br><br>
  <li>Limit the amount of processes of the current shell using <code> ulimit -u &lt;limit&gt;</code>
    <br>

      That's it for today guys , DYE 👋 !<br><br>

      <br><br><br>The following are a few SS from my experience <br>
