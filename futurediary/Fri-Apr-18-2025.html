      ohayo minna ! <br>
      so I was using the random function from python , and thought even C could do this and was coding random functions in C. <br>
      Realised C doesn't have built-ins like <code>random.choice</code> or <code>random.randint</code> etc. <br> <br>

      Anyways at the low lever its all about randomness, which can be produced just by a random event [ we can just take that event to be numbers ]. <br>
      The <code>rand()</code> in c provides a <em>pseudo-random</em>[ a random number generated by a DETERMINISTIC ALGORITHM ] <b>number</b> everytime it is run . <br>
      so you can essentially mod that randomness to some length and make that <em>random <sup>th</sup> </em> number as the index of an array that has . . <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Images</li>
        <li>Strings</li>
        <li>characters</li>
        <li>binaries</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      And there you have it - you achieved the same pseudo <em>Funcationality</em> <br>
      <br>
      Cool ? But I was just looking at why we need to seed a random generator at the start of each <code>c</code> program . like <br>
      <pre>
      <code>
      #include<time.h>
      srand(time(NULL))
      </code>
      </pre>
      <br>
      Now read carefully
      This is done so that it doesn't follow  a random <em><b><u><code>SEQUENCE</code></u></b></em>
      <br><br>Yeah no - totally not understanding , GPT knew the exact values as well so see the output . . . <br><br>
