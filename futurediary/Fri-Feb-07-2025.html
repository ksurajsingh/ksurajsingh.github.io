Feels good won 2nd price in my first tech talk on Cyber Security on 6th Feb 2025. <br>
It was a state level competition in my old college. I was not first .. but idk .. happy ,cuz I enjoyed my time. Maybe not - I had to wait for a very long time for other pariticipants to complete ,, but it might be worth it I G . <br><br>

And today had the phase-2/3 presentation for a project that evaluates 3  4-credits combined subjects . It ended well - traditionally like all traditional education schema - it took whole day just to get to my turn but - it was good at the end. The valuators liked our porject and I felt good. <br><br>

There was a beef [ IDK what that's called ], Between students and a management teacher who didn't valuate students properly - is what was said [ I support that ]. Things were pretty hot . Felt good. <br><br>

I liked that students in my college and specifially my class are considerate on marks [ support system for me ] tho I don't like to care about the traditional marking system . cuzzzzzz <br><br>

Some chinese ai is on the verge of being sued by microsoft . <br>
Who wouldn't like that. <br> <br>

and here we students are - "sorry ma'am , I didn't set the line spacing to 1.15 ðŸ˜­, Please don't cut my marks ðŸ¥¹" <br><br><br>
