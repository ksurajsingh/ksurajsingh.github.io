        Hey guys, how is it going ! 
        <br>
        Came to a hackathon rn . I didn't want to - my college made it madatory to get marks! 
        <br>
        I had a presentation at 3 50 PM - I reached by 3 55 - that is when my team went into the classroom beside our mentor's cabin <br>
        I was calling them - after 3/4 minutes they came out and say its over :) <br>
        Anyways I hope I don't lose marks. <br> 
        Manh! feels bad after travelling for 1.5 hours .  <br>
        It was raining as soon as I left home . It was a run till the metro - lil Sprint. <br>
        Drenched 40%.
