    so my laptop had <code>auto-cpufreq</code> running , which I wasn't aware of and I was trying to change back the cpu
    governors and boost state - but it always reverted back .<br>
    After trying to debug for a long time , I figured to check the <code>pacman</code> logs and <code>yay</code> logs to
    remember what I downloaded related to my cpu , cuz I got heating issues in my lappy. <br>

    <br><br><br>
    I just remembered about auto-cpufreq and it did the work just as the name suggested - as soon as I disabled it I was
    able to change the governors and boost state <br><br>
    <b>TL;DR: </b> When I change the cpu cycles to less than 2 Ghz . It implements it , but just for a fraction of
    second and then reverts back to 4.3 Ghz . <br>
    Due to which my lappy got heated and fan was always running . <br>
    This revert was caused by <code>auto-cpufreq</code> which handles the cpu frequency <b>by default</b> <em>at all
      times</em>. <br>
    So me changing the cpu frequency was rendered <b>NULL</b> at that very instance.
    <br><br>
    fix: just disable <code>auto-cpufreq</code>

    Both my laptop and desktop only support full clock speed when the driver is the manufacturer of the cpu . <br>
    At the same time that driver <b>does not</b> support other drivers such as "conservative" "ondemand" "shedutil" etc
