I commited an API to github [publicly] and wanted to remove that . <br> 
At first I thought of removing the whole repo [deleting it] <br>
      Then I found this CLI tool <pre>
      <a href="https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo">git-filter-repo</a></pre>
    <p id="blog"> which helps you to rewriter history .<br>

    I commited my Gemini API key in <a href="github.com:surajk013/hotel-management-system">here</a> on gen part [which is for the AI part]
<br><br> I did rewrite , Lemme k if you find any keys there [thanks]. <br>
    so now I don't need to delete the repo.<br><br>
