    I commited an API to github [publicly] and wanted to remove that . <br>
    At first I thought of removing the whole repo [deleting it] <br>
    Then I found this CLI tool
  <pre>
    <a href="https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo">git-filter-repo</a>
  </pre>
  <p id="blog"> which helps you to rewriter history .<br>
    and <b>Doesn't</b> actually makes a commit - so even if you push - no one is noticed or no one <b>can</b> notice.

    <br><br>
    I commited my Gemini API key in <a href="github.com:surajk013/hotel-management-system">here</a> on gen part [which
    is for the AI part]
    <br><br> I did rewrite , Lemme k if you find any keys there [thanks]. <br>
    so now I don't need to delete the repo.<br><br>
