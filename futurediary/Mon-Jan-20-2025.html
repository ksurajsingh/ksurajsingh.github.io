before starting to make this website -   I had internals and I had theory of computing - which was considered the hardest subject of this semester .<br> <br>
  
<h2>Time to spill a bean </h2><hr>
    <p id="blog">
I actually already failed a subject in my 3rd semester [ I am currently in 5th semester ]. Linear Algebra and I failed it - it was very bad . The first subject I ever failed in my life and it was right in the first semester of my CSE-Cyber Security engineering ! <br><br>

      I took diploma right after 10th and not Pre-Univesity [PUC] where they teach you maths physics and chemistry which contains formulae that someone derived spending their entire life only so that the people in the future can use it and not spend their time again to by-heart [mug up] the same thing only to puke it <br><img src="futurediarymedia/puks.gif"><br>in the exam and remember nothing.<br>
In diploma since maths is only in the first semester and only basic- I will get a lot of time to use computers - is what I though but for some reason - I did everything I though of in my schools that I will do after 10th <br><br>

and did those - things like making friends [ you now what friends ;) ] and doing some cool stuff which I cannot rememeber later to write in my blog. <br> <br>

then college done - its still march something the syllabus for CET hasn't come up 
<br><br><br>
In June comes the syllabus for the CET - <br> I though the syllabus is the same for all the X amount of people writing the exam and so - I will just get 1st Rank <br> The 1st rank in my state - how cool is that . <br><br><br>

Then I close my eyes and open my eyes and 20 days are remainging <br><br> 

So I thought - let's say a college has a cutoff of 100 then the person who gets 1st rank and the one who gets 99th rank get into the same college right ? no difference ya only like the 1st ranker sacrified everything and studied 5 more hours everyday than the 99th ranker - It might help him somewhere else in life - but I think why to gamble in such a way instead use the same remainging 5 hours of time in learning something that you can gaurantee you will use it in future .<br><br> 

Now we live life ; <br>
life is probabilistic ;<br>
Nothing can be determined fully; <br> 
why not atleast do something that has higher changes , right ? 

so I think to balance life in that way - and that is only fair for me right now . 

<br><br><br><br> <code><b>SPILLED BEAN</b></code> coming back to the original topic.


as I said about balacing - I didn't write the 3 subjects of my 2nd internals only to study for Theory of Compting , since I already failed a mathematical based subject - .<br><br>

Today I saw my marks - it was 32/50 in test and 5/10 in quiz .<br>
This is my all time highest in a mathematical [ to be precise : in a subject that many people fail ] subject . The last one was 22 in Linear Algebra <br><br>
I am really happy - I might take home some healthy foods to eat :) yay !! very happy ! cannot express my confidence <br><br>

I passed the 4th sem mathematics and my confidence knew no bounds - and now this thing . mahn ! I am overflowing with confidence - I feel like hacking NASA . phew! too easy bruh . <br><br>

<h2> Key Takeaway </h2><hr>
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li> Maintain Balance in life - lock in only when its utmost necessary [ which I think is a time that never comes in someone's life ]. Most of the times when I sacrificed things - I learnt It was only a gamble Instead increase the amount of time you spend on something else <br><br>

        <li>Don't plan time - just work hard <b>without wasting time</b> . and you will have enough time to watch anime and do stuff that you feel entertaining or relaxing at the end of the day .<br><br>

        <li> relaxing is important , it is part of training , muscles and stuff, cuz it recovers . And in brain - when you relax the hypocamus it transfers everything from RAM to ROM , so you remember stuff .<br><br>
