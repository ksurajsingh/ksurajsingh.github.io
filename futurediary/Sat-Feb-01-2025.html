      Highly recommend - silicon valley to CS students and <code>gintama</code> <br><br>

I just came across this thing called as <code>a manga guide to</code> it has so many topics and they are acutally a manga scene guide like a pov of manga and they explain very engineered topics like calculus , logistic regression, statistics , databases, universe . <br><br> Just try downloading it at <a href="https://pdfroom.com/books/the-manga-guide-to-the-universe/jGk208rl2pm" alt="link-to-pdfRoom">universe</a><br><br>

<b>P.S</b>: I want to tag my blog with a particular tags - so you can just read the ones that you like - lets see that - added to todo list <br><br>

Oh yeah bugswriter just commented on my video 5 days ago - I had internals - so couldn't check mails - here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKtCIGUz_lY&lc=UgxNrIwJNasDCpRGJ5Z4AaABAg&ab_channel=Warlord13" alt="link-to-the-comment-ofBUGS-on-my-yt">comment</a><br><br>



<code id="important"> some [CS stuff below] </code>

about that systemd - I created 3 - for zram , for cpuGovernor , and for enableCpuBoost. <br>
<ul>
        <li><b>zram</b><br> get the swap to how much ever you want , will talk about this some day later.</li>
        <li><b>cpuGovernor</b><br> This is the most interesting thing <br> 
          I actually had heating issues with my new laptop [acer a325-42 octa core ]. And so I booted to windows , and it was pretty silent <br><br>
          I went on a lil deep and discovered <code>cpupower</code>  there I got to know about governors <br><br>

    <ol>
            <pre> <li> <code>powersave</code> most power efficient </li>
                <li> <code>conservative</code> can increase the performance when necessary slowly </li>
                <li> <code>ondemand</code> can increase the performance aggresively on demand </li>
                <li> <code>userspace</code> only uses the specified cpu frequency set by the user </li>
                <li> <code>schedutil</code> works in batch as the resources are demanded the cpu power just keeps increasing without any conern for power and only for performance [ the older ones main concern was power ].</li>
                <li> <code>perofrmance</code> gives peak performance using the cpu's core to its highest available frequency . </li><br>
            </pre>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li> <b><u>enableCpuBoost</u></b> This is used to enable the cpu limit to as much as speciifed by the hardware vendor. you can even surpass the limit [overclocking] . That is exactly opposite is what I do - cuz I need my pc to come in a long run . Overclocking has exactly the issues I don't wanna face at their best possible harm rate - heating issue. <br></li>
      </ul>
      <br><br>
    <p id="blog">
This cpupower is acutally <code>very powerfull</code>. Use it with high caution. <br><br>
Don't play with it ! <br>
