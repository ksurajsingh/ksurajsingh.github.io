I wish one of my successors / decendant is enough capable to remove all kinds of inequalities from the world. <br><br>
Most importantly money - and show everyone that we all stand on equal grounds and are equal from birth to death. <br><br>
Technically the world wouldn't progress further - if there is nothing greater than any other thing - there is no change - there is nothing to do . <br><br>

Just to have fun and flex the bloodline capabilities.
