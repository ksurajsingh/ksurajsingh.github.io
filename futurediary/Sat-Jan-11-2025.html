Wish I could have bought a server and a domain <br>
nothing better or different really - but could maintain a fully functional / private space on internet and maybe host media files ,but 3000 per year is a cost for me rn.<br><br>
I hope I get rich soon <br>
BTW tried to use redmi 3s today the borders function , scrcpy won't as USB debuggin secure won't turn on cuz there is no sim and my PC won't even detect the phone on cable <br><br>
I hereby render 3s and sony t2 ultra dual useless.... I am not going to waste my time on them .... maybe my cur_phone can be my secondary when I get a new one but atleast I can use it . I really hate it when my time gets wasted. Focused rn! <br><br>

uninstalling bloat from life . . . . . <br><br>

      <b>P.S</b>: in my sense uninstalling bloat means to the very core, where you only do the things that are <b>necessary</b> . And I <b>might</b> do yoga since I am following a 12-4 now [what that is you might know later someday]
