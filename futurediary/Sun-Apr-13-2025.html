      Hey there , how is it going ! <br>
      I just unzipped some of my old files that had the code that I used to write when I was first coding . <br>
      At that time I thought that coding is a really engineered topic and it would take a lotta of times <br>
      Even to read the code that I wrote so might as well just delete it <br><br>
      But for some reason I just zipped it and brought it with me till here <br>
      It contains lotta of code looknig back I feel proud of my self <br>
      I can see a program that does match making for the IPL cricket league in <code>java</code> <br>
      A ticket system for a parking lot in <code>C</code> for 2 and 4 and other wheelers depending on the time they spend on parking <br><br>
      <br><br>

      I actually did this beaucse in a recent interview I was asked a very silly question which I wasn't able to answer <br>
      <em>The difference in union and structures in C</em>. 
      This might not have been the deciding factor in my <em>rejection</em> but I still hoped' I'd give a correct answers for as many questions as possible <br>
      C is something that I have <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/profile/surajsinghk013" alt="link to hacker rank profile">5 star hacker rank rating </a> that too in 2022 <br>
      <br>

      So as time passed I felt these basic topics were very silly to take space in brain and didn't give them any importance and eventually I forgot them <br>
      But now i don't feel code as an overengineered topic since its been around 3-5 years since I began coding so I can now read code easily make reviews and stuff <br>
      And I really enjoy it as well , P.S: that's what I do in my free time [ maybe I don't have a free time ]. <br>
     <br><br>

     Oh yea! I might make a repo that will contain some code that I have written .You know looking back at the frist code you ever wrote always gives a chill and goosebumps <br>
     I will notify you guys when I do that in some other blog, I still haven't gone throught the files yet , Its in GBs , maybe I have some tutorial videos as well so that's that <br>
     Also why I am making lots of html these days so everything I study related to CS is available in the web format on the internet , I am putting it on github and will mostly host in versel [ my website currently at surajk013.github.io ] and once I have moni will buy myself a <b>Domain</b><em> buhahaha ðŸ˜ˆ</em>
     <br><br>
     <em>OK </em>

      <h2>Key takeaways</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Retention of what you learnt is important</b><br>Else it all for nothing just a waste , it a FIFO like structure with no bounds to the memory / knowledge enter and leaves after a sleep <br> 
          That's useless isn't it 
        </li>
        <li><b>Never delete make zip outta it</b> and just store it somewhere call it store room [ for what you consider garbage ]</li>
        <li><b> Recalling stuff is very important </b>It actually refreshes that part of your memory <br> That's what is gonna allow you to have better retention and eventully better knowledge <br>
          It all gonna progress just <blockquote> believe in yourself </blockquote>
        </li>
      </ol>
