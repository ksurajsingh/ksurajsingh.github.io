      Things happen, then they are over. You just can't explain them <br>

      I had a interview . Learnt a lot <b><big>Control is an Illusion.</big></b> <br>
      I once again thought to restrict some thing that <b>I thought</b> were not important and just focus on studies. <br>
      Restricting anything , anything at all is literally a waste.It just hinders you capability and creative nothing else.

      I worked on a paper that got published <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387649202_Temporal_Analysis_and_Common_Weakness_Enumeration_CWE_Code_Prediction_for_Software_Vulnerabilities_using_Machine_Learning">here</a>. IDK why I cannot find my name in the team there. I don't even have the IEEE link.
