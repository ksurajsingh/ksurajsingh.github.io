There are going be moments in life , when you lose something . Something that's a permanent lose , which you cannot get back. At those moments if you feel bad , its mostly because you knew you could have it [or] becuase someone else has it.<br><br>

For instance lets take the most precious resource of humanity <b>TIME</b> . <br>

      Lets say you had 10 hours and lost 5 of it . <br>
      Now you only have 5 hours remaining.<br>
      No matter what you do - you only have 5 hours. <br>
      Now, your friend / Colleague would have done <b>X+Y</b> as both take 5 hours <b>each</b>. But you are now only able to do X. <br><br>

<pre> <code class="red">[!WARNING] [Great learnings]</code></pre> 
    <blockquote>If you try to do both X+Y in the given 5 hours you won't be able to complete either of them unless its something you are already good at / have experience of . </blockquote><br><br><br>


<h2> Takeaway</h2>

      1. <b>You lost something</b> - that's life <br>
Guts isn't winning alone , especially winning alone . Guts is facing all odds and still moving forwards , [Sylvester Stallone said it well] Its not about how hard you hit , but how hard get hit <b>and</b> keep moving forwards . Its about how much you can take.<br><br>

2. Understanding your true capabilities inorder to decide your next move is where you win half the battle [inspired form Itachi Uchiha]<br><br>
      <img src="futurediarymedia/gif.gif"><br>

      3. [and the most important of all] . When you are honest and know that you have less capabilities , improve . Remember the defination of life isn't getting a output or a certain particular result ! That's exactly not what life is , that's a machine . Infact there is no defination for life , <span><blockquote> Life is an experience</blockquote></span> . If you could get exactly the number of gold medals Ronaldo got , that's not life . The amount of hardwark you put inorder to get those is the Life. <br> 

So does the output matter ? <br> <em>Yes</em> , but <br>
      Should the output impact the way you look at life? <br> <b>Not Always</b> when you lose, the world doesn't become dirty , its just you who had less inputs [hardwork] Next time work hard and you shall have it . <br><br>Work harder that's what you should learn.<br><br>


<b>P.S</b>: I hope I could level up just the way I aged up [or like Sung Jinwoo in Solo Levelling], I guess maybe I have, you know mentally and morally . The more I live the more I feel that the stories / tales / poems / what ever you call them like the **rabbit and the tortoise** are super underrated and super important in life
