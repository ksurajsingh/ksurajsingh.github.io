    So I was just mixed up with some work and I couldn't post here much <br>
    How is it going 👋! <br><br>

    P.S: `Not work` - it was normal, I just couldn't.. I was just slacking. <br>
    So I just found this [ now u k what I was doing ] and I realised how these things can be used to explain such
    complex topics.<br>
    Here is my point: You know that you could pay money and own something in today's age right? <br>
    <b>How much are you owning it?</b>
    cuz when you take a subscription of an OTT platform you still have to pay for some of the movies - just to rent them
    ?
    <br>
    and you still can't
  <ul>
    <li>Manipulate it</li>
    <li>Copy it</li>
    <li>Use it for your own non-profitable purpose</li>
    <li>Use it for your own for-profit purpose</li>
    <li>Share it</li>
    <li>Actually store it the way you want</li>
    <li>Use it in your own way [ say I brought a movie but I can't watch it in my native place it since its in my TV at
      my home ]</li>
  </ul>

  The video here gives you a proper illustration [ cuz we don't have any depiction <b>afaik</b> ]. <br>
  <video src="./futurediarymedia/shin-chan-landlord.mkv" controls> </video>
  Of how something which is very valuable like a land property can't be ENTIRELY yours!!!!!!!!!. <br>
  you know that there are a few things that people invest on which actually makes money . <br>
  <em>Warren buffest has told </em> <br>
  <em>Some guy in the reels explained it to his daughter</em> <br>
  That - don't invest in paper but real wealth - say mineral [ maybe mars has more gold ].
  <br>
  In land [ maybe inter-planetary travel's deflation could reduce the value of land you own on earth ].
  <br>
  And our beloved crypto .
  <br>
  last and the strongest amongst all - NFT ! .
  <br><br><br>
  IDK about other but land . . .
  I like that ideology and desire it ,but . . . <br> <br>
  When you pay for a piece of land . You do realise that you brought a land which is <b>**ALREADY**</b> a part of an
  established <em>3c1c67d00c742cb72b84d19a68</em>. <br><br>
  You may pay the taxes to the <em>3c1c67d00c742cb72b84d19a68</em> - <br> you may do all the repairs to the property .<br>
  But they own the place which covers the space that you own. <br>
  OKAY WAIT BYE. <br><br>

  I end my case - all this was just a joke 🃏. <br>
  I am scared 🤣.<br>
  IYKYK <br>
  SAYONARAAAAAAAAA!<br>
  P.S(P.S): [ PeSu no PeSu ] What a coincidence I exactly 3 months ago talked about how old cartoon were so meaningful [
  I think that's when I started posting about old cartoons ]
