  ALl 3 ongoing - What a great time to be in [ could solo leveling join the list - never tried to notice ]
  <br><br>
  P.S: I gave up `chatting` on discord and telegram and wassap . The thing is, its just <b>chatting</b> cuz if its
  informative I still chat. <br>
  But if its just for the sake of convo I don't, especially argument <em>Just to prove A point</em>. If its argument as
  to giving out features of what is better or what is not which could supplement my knowledge base - I am all in.
  Elsewise its just a waste of time . I did realise that when I was doing it. But I gave up just very recently I no
  longer have the urge to <code><b>`PROVE`</b></code> something - <br>
  [ BTW I got one more Panchatantra kind of thing ] <br>

  Check my instagram for videos it would be in a post and a highlight .<br>
  [Update next day: I hit 13 today - 13:59] <br><br>

  BTW I found a nice quote in one of the one punch man edits - <br>
  <code>Being a hero is not about raising a fists, but lending a hand.</code>
