      first look at this : <br>
      <pre>
      You are asked to pick -    [could pick goat[a] <em>or</em> goat[b] <em>or</em> car]
          The host reveals *a goat* - [the goat[a or b] is kicked out of the equation now]
               asked to change mind.    [could <code>change mind</code> <em>or</em> <code>not change mind</code>]

      All possibilities : 
      (You chose goat[a]üêê):
            goat[b] is kicked
            you(<span class="change">change</span> mind):
                <span class="win">win</span> 
            else:
                <span class="lose">lose</span>
      (you chose goat[b]üêê):
            goat[a] is kicked
            you(<span class="change">change</span> mind):
                <span class="win">win</span> 
            else:
                <span class="lose">lose</span>:
      (you chose car üöó):
            goat[a or b] is kicked 
            you(<span class="change">change</span> mind):
                <span class="lose">lose</span> 
            else:
                <span class="win">win</span>
      This is only one iteration of the game.
      But if you observe - There are 2 wins when you *changed* your mind. And this is regardless of any pick.
      What does that say? 
      when you picked a car.A goat is revealed.
      switching loses - so you shouldn't switch.
      But, 
      If you'd pick a goat. *ANOTHER* goat is revealed.
      switching wins, so you should switch.

      Now, we have learnt that . . .
      if picked car - don't switch 
      if picked goat - do switch

      But, how do you know if you had picked a goat or car - you can't. That is exactly why it doesn't have a 100% win probability. 
      chances of you picking a car - 1/3 = 33%  [ should *NOT* switch ]
      chacnes of you picking a goat - 2/3 = 66% [ should switch ]

      And that is how 
      You SHOULD switch - 66% of time 
      you should NOT switch - 33% of time. 

      Since we don't know what are those 33% of time are - we just go with the one that give more probability of winning.
      And chose to SWITCH every single time.

      [ BTW - if you'd know what are those 33% of times are - you'd
      WIN 
      EVERY 
      SINGLE 
      TIME üíÄ .
      which is undeterministic ü§•. ]


      Explaination for geeks who say: well , you are not thinking from the POV of the other door after the revealation. 
      Your first pick got 33% car and so the other 2 doors got 66% - since there were 2 doors 
      you had to divide the probability for each door i.e 66% divided for 2 doors .
      1/2 for door no.2 and 1/2 for door no.3 . 33% each.
      Since door no.2 got revealed and it wasn't a car. Therefore the entire 66% is now divided by only one door. i.e door no.3 
      and that is how door no.1 is 33% and no.3 is 66%. 


      Explaination for nerds who say: What if we had chosen the door no.3 to begin with 
      In that case door no.1 would now be @ 66% probability of having a car.
      Yes, you choice does matter in the final reveal.
      As it also does in the door that is picked by the host AFTER your pick.
